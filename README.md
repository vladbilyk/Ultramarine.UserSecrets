# Ultramarine.UserSecrets
This project is Visual Studio for Mac extension with missing UI for [ASP.NET Core Secret Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=macos#secret-manager) tool. The extension works similar to "Manage User Secrets" context menu command in Visual Studio on Windows:

* Select C# project in Solution Pad.
* Click to _Manage User Secrets_ context menu item (or _Project_ - _Manage User Secrets_ menu item).
* Manage your secrets in the opened secrets.json (if file does not exist it will be created).
